// Server-only Admin SDK fetch by listing id.
//
// lib/listings.ts's fetchListingById uses the CLIENT Firebase SDK
// (getDoc against lib/firebase.ts's `db`), which needs browser context and
// can't run in a Server Component. No server-side single-doc read action
// exists in api/listings/_handler.js either — the original SPA never
// needed one, since a listing was always already in memory from the feed
// before mpOpenModal ran. This is genuinely new: a direct-by-id server
// read for the /listing/[id] route's generateMetadata + initial render.
//
// Deliberately colocated with the page rather than added to
// api/listings/_handler.js's action surface — that file is a byte-for-byte
// port of the original api/listings.js and this isn't part of that port.

// Note: the `server-only` npm package would normally guard this file at
// build time, but it isn't in package.json and this sandbox has no network
// access to verify `npm install` succeeds — see adminDb.ts's header comment.
// Relying instead on the fact that this is only ever imported from
// Server Components (page.tsx below, sitemap.ts).
import { getAdminDb, serializeTimestamps } from "@/lib/server/adminDb";

// `segment` is the raw /listing/[id] route param — either the new
// "title-slug-{id}" format or a legacy bare id. idFromListingSlug pulls
// the real Firestore id out of either shape; the slug prefix itself is
// never trusted for the lookup (see lib/slug.ts's header comment), only
// used to make the URL readable.
