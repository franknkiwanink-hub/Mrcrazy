// Recently-viewed listings — purely client-side (localStorage), no
// Firestore reads/writes, no auth requirement. Records a lightweight
// snapshot of exactly the fields ListingCard's three variants (Site/App/
// Game) actually render — same subset SaveButton already snapshots for
// its own favorites doc — rather than a full Listing, so re-rendering a
// recently-viewed card never needs a second network fetch just to draw
// the strip.
//
// Deliberately NOT synced to Firestore / cross-device: this is meant to
// be an instant, always-available "what did I just look at" trail, not
// a durable feature — same tradeoff a browser's own history makes.
