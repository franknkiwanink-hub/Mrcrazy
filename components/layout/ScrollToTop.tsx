// Fixes: clicking a footer link (or any link near the bottom of a long
// window-scrolled page, e.g. Home) navigates to the new page but the
// window stays scrolled to wherever the click happened — so the new
// page mounts already scrolled down to roughly where the footer was,
// instead of at the top. Then hitting Back re-triggers the same thing
// in reverse, so it *looks* like "going back always lands on the
// footer" even though the real cause is the forward navigation never
// resetting scroll in the first place.
//
// Root cause: most of this app's pages (Settings, Marketplace, the
// listing/seller detail views, etc.) scroll an inner `overflow-y: auto`
// panel rather than the window, so the browser's own native "new page
// starts at the top" behavior and Next's scroll-restoration heuristics
// don't reliably apply — the ones that DO use plain window scroll
// (Home, the static pages, and by extension Footer, which lives at the
// bottom of window-scrolled flow on those pages) are the ones this
// bites, since nothing was ever forcing the window itself back to 0.
//
// Previous fix attempt just trusted the browser's native scroll
// restoration on Back/Forward (popstate) and only forced scrollTo(0,0)
// on forward navigations. That doesn't actually work for the footer
// case: native restoration remembers wherever the window was scrolled
// to at the moment you navigated away — which, if you clicked a footer
// link, IS the footer position. So Back "restores" you right back to
// the footer, reproducing the exact bug this was meant to fix.
//
// Real fix: track our own scroll memory per pathname in sessionStorage.
// Right before any forward navigation, save the current page's scroll
// position under its own pathname key. On Back/Forward (popstate),
// restore from OUR saved value for the page being returned to (which
// was captured back when the user was still reading that page, before
// they scrolled down to click a link) instead of the browser's native
// value (which reflects click-time position, not read-time position).
